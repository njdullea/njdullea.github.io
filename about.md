## Currently Under Construction

Welcome to Nathan Dullea's blog. This is where I will write about many things. 

The blog is currently under construction. Here are some things I want to do: 

1. Improve the look. Including making the footer Smaller, Color in the header, move dates to the side of posts, make the top post be bigger and have a picture, and add an icon for the page tab. 
2. Add functionality. Including a filter for the categories of posts shown, a search bar, and add Analytics/SEO. 
3. Write More!
