Hello World

<br><br><br>

I have followed the instructions here:
https://pages.github.com/

<br><br><br>

Now time to try and do jekyll stuff then make a blogpost!

<br>

For Jekyll, I am following this: https://jekyllrb.com/docs/

<br> 

I completed the instructions, now I have a directory in my local repository called ./myblog I can view by going to http://localhost:4000 in a browser.
