Hello World

<br><br><br>

I have followed the instructions here:
https://pages.github.com/

<br><br><br>

Now time to try and do jekyll stuff then make a blogpost!

<br>

For Jekyll, I am following this: https://jekyllrb.com/docs/

<br> 

I completed the instructions, now I have a directory in my local repository called ./myblog I can view by imputing 'bundle exec jekyll serve' going to http://localhost:4000 in a browser. 



<br> transitioning from github pages to jekyll was confusing, because github had you make a directory, and then the jekyll link made you make a directory inside of that, but they should be the same!! so I had to use jekyll new . --force
