I have promised myself I would make blog for a while. 

I have made myself blog now. 

I will blog once a month about a project. 

Since this is a blog, I might as well offer some interesting thoughts: 

`The worm is just a horizontal wave`

And

`Triscuits are disgusting`

Welcome to hell. 


-Nathan



On a side note, here are the resources I used to make this blog:

[github pages][ghp]

https://michaelsoolee.com/undo-gem-based-jekyll-theme/

https://jekyllrb.com/docs/themes/

The parts I had difficulty with were knowing how to convert the already made github pages repository
to a jekyll blog. To do this:

`jekyll new . --force`


Another difficulty was understanding gem based themes, and that they are more about making it
easy for the developers of those themes to update them, then it is about making the user (me) 
easily understand what is happening and how to make changes to the theme. 

I had to follow how to make the gem based theme local, thus the article from michaelsoolee :)
